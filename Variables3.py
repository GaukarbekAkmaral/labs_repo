x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
#In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
#You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
a = "Python "
b = "is "
c = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)
print(a + b + c)
#For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
f = 5
g = 10
print(f + g)
